# Nike Manufacturing
Spring 2019

In this project, I looked at Nike's public data on where they manufacture their products 
and performed exploratory data analysis. The first question I considered was, 
"Does Nike export the majority of it's manufacturing to other regions? If so, 
which regions are the most popular?". In addition to that, I looked at the question, "Does 
location affect what kind of good is produced (as in materials, finished goods, etc)? If so, why?". 
When looking at both of these questions, I used Python alongside the libraries pandas and 
matplotlib in order to clean the data, create graphs, and further interpret the dataset. 
This project was my first exposure to using python in the context of Data Science, 
so this project was mostly used as a learning experience in understanding both python and 
pandas/matplotlib as a whole.
